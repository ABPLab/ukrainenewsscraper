MOSCOW: Russia has closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries, including all 27 members of the European Union in response to a slew of bans on its planes over its invasion of Ukraine.
Some of the banned countries had already been identified, while others were named by the aviation authority Rosaviatsia for the first time on Monday following the punitive measures imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The flight bans are expected to hurt airlines that fly over the world's biggest country to get from Europe to Asia. They are likely to force them to find new routes.
Rosaviatsia said that flights from those countries could in exceptional circumstances be authorised if they secure special clearance from Russia's aviation authority or foreign ministry.
It listed the countries as Albania, Anguilla, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, British Virgin Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Hungary, Greece, Denmark, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Jersey, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Last week, Russia banned UK airlines after Britain barred Aeroflot, the country's flagship carrier, as well as private jets.
The European Union announced on Sunday that it was closing its airspace to Russian aircraft, including private jets.
These measures will mean airlines have to make long detours on some routes, potentially raising the cost of tickets.
