Spanish club Real Madrid will donate €1 million to help those displaced in Ukraine following Russia's invasion, the LaLiga leaders said on Wednesday (Mar 16).
Real said the funds would be donated to the Red Cross, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other organisations working on the ground in Ukraine.
The UNHCR said approximately 2.97 million refugees have so far fled Ukraine, roughly 7 per cent of the country's population, since Russia's invasion began on Feb 24.
