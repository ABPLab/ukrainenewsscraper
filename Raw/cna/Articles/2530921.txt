PARIS: Two of the world's largest aircraft makers have suspended the supply of spare parts to Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine.
Airbus said on Wednesday (Mar 2) that it had stopped sending spare parts to Russia and supporting Russian airlines, but was analysing whether its Moscow engineering centre could keep providing services to local customers under Western sanctions.
"The Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia (ECAR) has put on hold all its operations for Airbus in line with sanctions," the company said.
"Regarding engineering services ECAR provides to its Russian customers, ECAR is analysing the export control sanctions to determine if this activity can be maintained in line with the sanctions," Airbus said, adding it obeys all applicable laws.
The Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia was set up in 2003 under a joint-venture between Airbus, Systema Invest and the Kaskol group and employs 200 Russian engineers, according to the company's website.
Meanwhile, US manufacturer Boeing Co said on Tuesday it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines as well as major operations in Moscow.
"As the conflict continues, our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region," a Boeing spokesperson said.
The announcement came a day after Boeing said it had paused operations at its Moscow Training Campus and temporarily closed its office in Kyiv.
