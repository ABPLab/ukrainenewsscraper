LONDON: Belarusian clubs and the national team will have to play all their home matches in UEFA competitions at neutral venues with no spectators allowed, European football's governing body announced on Thursday (Mar 3).
Belarus has been used as a key staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, drawing widespread condemnation.
"The UEFA Executive Committee met today and decided that all Belarusian clubs and national teams competing in UEFA competitions will be required to play their home matches at neutral venues with immediate effect," a statement read.
"Furthermore, no spectators shall attend matches in which the teams from Belarus feature as host."
UEFA said its Executive Committee would convene further extraordinary meetings, on a regular ongoing basis, to reassess the legal and factual situation as it evolves and adopt further decisions as necessary.
World governing body FIFA and UEFA have already suspended Russia's national teams and clubs from international football until further notice as a result of the invasion.
Earlier on Thursday, Russian and Belarusian athletes were barred from the Winter Paralympics in Beijing on the eve of the Games following threats of boycotts by other teams.
