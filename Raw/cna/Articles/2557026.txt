BEIJING: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday (Mar 11) the Ukraine situation was "disconcerting" and that it is important to support Russia and Ukraine in ceasefire talks.
Speaking at a news conference at the close of the annual parliamentary session, Li did not directly answer Reuters' questions about whether China will refrain from condemning Russia no matter what that country does, or whether China is prepared to provide further economic and financial support for Russia as it faces sanctions.
China and Russia have forged an increasingly close partnership, and China has refused to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine or call it an invasion.
Beijing has repeatedly expressed its opposition to what it describes as illegal sanctions imposed by the West on Russia, and has called for a negotiated solution to the crisis.
Meanwhile, Li confirmed on Friday plans to step down after his current term expires next March.
The No 2 in the hierarchy of China's ruling Communist Party, Li has been premier since 2013, and is constitutionally limited to two terms.
"This is the last year I will be premier," Li told a news conference.
